## Introduction

AVSL is *a very simple logger*, written in [Scala][]. AVSL implements the
[Simple Logging Facade for Java][SLF4J] (SLF4J) API, allowing applications
to be written to the [SLF4J][] API. (This, of course, includes Java
applications.) Because it implements SLF4J, AVSL can easily be swapped for
another SLF4J-compatible logging framework (or the other way around),
without any changes to the calling application. Also, because it supports
SLF4J, AVSL can be used in conjunction with Scala SLF4J wrappers, such as
[Grizzled-SLF4J][].

"AVSL" stands for "A Very Simple Logger", and AVSL strives for simplicity
in several ways.

* AVSL is simple to configure, using a non-XML, INI-style configuration
  file that's reminiscent of the [Python logging module][]'s configuration.
  This simpler configuration file is easier to read and edit than the XML
  configuration files used by logging frameworks such as [Logback][].
  (Since I dislike XML configuration files, this is big win for me.)
* AVSL is a lightweight logging framework. It is intended to be used
  primarily in standalone programs, not enterprise applications. It may
  work fine for your enterprise application, of course; but, if it doesn't,
  you can easily switch to something else.
* The default message formatter uses a simpler, more compact syntax than
  Java's `SimpleDateFormat`, relying on `strftime`-like escapes.
* You can specify the configuration file via an environment variable
  (`AVSL_CONFIG`) or a Java system property. If neither is present, AVSL
  looks for resource `avsl.conf` somewhere in the classpath.
* The built-in logging handlers are thread-safe.
* AVSL does not monitor and reload its configuration file.
* AVSL does not implement the SLF4J marker or MDC capabilities.
* AVSL does not wrap other logging frameworks.
* AVSL does not let programmers define their own log levels.

In short, AVSL is a perfectly serviceable, simple logging framework that can
easily be swapped out for something with more features.

## Installation

AVSL is published to the `oss.sonatype.org` repository and automatically
sync'd with the [Maven Central Repository][].

* Version 1.0 supports Scala 2.10.0-M7
* Version 0.4 supports Scala 2.9.2, 2.9.1-1, 2.9.1, 2.9.0-1, 2.9.0, 2.8.2,
  2.8.1 and 2.8.0.

### Installing for Maven

If you're using [Maven][], just give it the artifact, and Maven will do the rest:

* Group ID: `clapper.org`
* Artifact ID: `avsl_2.9.2` or `avsl_2.10`
* Version: `0.4` or `1.0`
* Type: `jar`

For example:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.clapper</groupId>
      <artifactId>avsl_2.10</artifactId>
      <version>1.0</version>
    </dependency>

For more information on using Maven and Scala, see Josh Suereth's
[Scala Maven Guide][].

### Using with SBT

#### 0.7.x

If you're using [SBT][] 0.7.x to compile your code, you can place the
following line in your project file (i.e., the Scala file in your
`project/build/` directory):

    val javaNetRepo = "Java.net Maven 2 Repo" at
        "http://download.java.net/maven/2"
    val avsl = "org.clapper" %% "avsl" % "0.4"

#### 0.11.x/0.12.x

If you're using [SBT][] 0.11.x or 0.12.x to compile your code, you can use the
following line in your `build.sbt` file (for Quick Configuration). If you're
using an SBT 0.11.x Full Configuration, you're obviously smart enough to figure
out what to do, on your own.

If you're using Scala 2.9.2 or earlier:

    libraryDependencies += "org.clapper" %% "avsl" % "0.4"

If you're using Scala 2.10:

    libraryDependencies += "org.clapper" % "avsl_2.10" % "1.0"

AVSL is also registered with [Doug Tangren][]'s excellent [ls.implicit.ly][]
catalog. If you use the `ls` SBT plugin, you can install AVSL with

    sbt> ls-install avsl

## Source Code Repository

The source code for AVSL is maintained on [GitHub][]. To clone the
repository, run this command:

    $ git clone git://github.com/bmc/avsl.git

Note: That gets you the trunk, which supports Scala 2.10 and later. If you
want the code for Scala 2.9, switch to the [pre-scala-2.10-fixes][] branch:

    $ cd avsl
    $ git co pre-scala-2.10-fixes

[pre-scala-2.10-fixes]: https://github.com/bmc/avsl/tree/pre-scala-2.10-fixes

## Building from Source

Building the library requires [SBT][] 0.12.0 for Scala 2.10, and 0.11.x for
Scala 2.9 or earlier. Install SBT, as described at the SBT web site.
Then, assuming you have an `sbt` shell script (or .BAT file, for Windows), run:

    sbt compile package

The resulting jar file will be in the top-level `target` directory.
