## Introduction

AVSL is *a very simple logger*, written in [Scala][]. AVSL implements the
[Simple Logging Facade for Java][SLF4J] (SLF4J) API, allowing applications
to be written to the [SLF4J][] API. (This, of course, includes Java
applications.) Because it implements SLF4J, AVSL can easily be swapped for
another SLF4J-compatible logging framework (or the other way around),
without any changes to the calling application. Also, because it supports
SLF4J, AVSL can be used in conjunction with Scala SLF4J wrappers, such as
[Grizzled-SLF4J][].

"AVSL" stands for "A Very Simple Logger", and AVSL strives for simplicity
in several ways.

* AVSL is simple to configure, using a non-XML, INI-style configuration
  file that's reminiscent of the [Python logging module][]'s configuration.
  This simpler configuration file is easier to read and edit than the XML
  configuration files used by logging frameworks such as [Logback][].
  (Since I dislike XML configuration files, this is big win for me.)
* AVSL is a lightweight logging framework. It is intended to be used
  primarily in standalone programs, not enterprise applications. It may
  work fine for your enterprise application, of course; but, if it doesn't,
  you can easily switch to something else.
* The default message formatter uses a simpler, more compact syntax than
  Java's `SimpleDateFormat`, relying on `strftime`-like escapes.
* You can specify the configuration file via an environment variable
  (`AVSL_CONFIG`) or a Java system property. If neither is present, AVSL
  looks for resource `avsl.conf` somewhere in the classpath.
* The built-in logging handlers are thread-safe.
* AVSL does not monitor and reload its configuration file.
* AVSL does not implement the SLF4J marker or MDC capabilities.
* AVSL does not wrap other logging frameworks.
* AVSL does not let programmers define their own log levels.

In short, AVSL is a perfectly serviceable, simple logging framework that can
easily be swapped out for something with more features.

## Installation

The easiest way to install AVSL is to download a pre-compiled jar from the
[Scala Tools Maven repository][]. However, you can also get certain build
tools to download it for you automatically.

### Installing for Maven

If you're using [Maven][], you can simply tell Maven to get AVSL from the
[Scala Tools Maven repository][]. The relevant pieces of information are:

* Group ID: `clapper.org`
* Artifact ID: `avsl_2.8.0`
* Version: `0.3`
* Type: `jar`
* Repository: `http://www.scala-tools.org/repo-releases/`

For example:

    <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>scala-tools.org</id>
          <name>Scala-tools Maven2 Repository</name>
          <url>http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.clapper</groupId>
      <artifactId>avsl_2.8.1</artifactId>
      <version>0.3.1</version>
    </dependency>

Version 0.3.1 is available for Scala 2.8.0 and Scala 2.8.1.

For more information on using Maven and Scala, see Josh Suereth's
[Scala Maven Guide][].

### Using with SBT

If you're using [SBT][] (the Simple Build Tool) to compile your code, you
can place the following lines in your project file (i.e., the Scala file in
your `project/build/` directory):

    val javaNetRepo = "Java.net Repository for Maven" at
        "http://download.java.net/maven/2"
    val newReleaseToolsRepository = ScalaToolsSnapshots
    val avsl = "org.clapper" %% "avsl" % "0.3.1"

**NOTES**

1. The first doubled percent is *not* a typo. It tells SBT to treat AVSL as
   a cross-built library and automatically inserts the Scala version you're
   using into the artifact ID. It will *only* work if you are building with
   Scala 2.8.0.final. See the [SBT cross-building][] page for details.
2. 2. Prior to AVSL, version 0.3, you also had to specify the location of a
   custom Maven repository. With version 0.3, however, AVSL is now being
   published to the [Scala Tools Maven repository][], which SBT
   automatically searches.
3. You *must* specify the Java.net and `ScalaToolsSnapshots` repositories,
   Even though those additional repositories are in the published AVSL
   Maven `pom.xml`, SBT will not read them. Under the covers, SBT uses
   [Apache Ivy][] for dependency management, and Ivy doesn't extract
   repositories from Maven POM files. If you don't explicitly specify the
   additional repositories listed above, `sbt update` will fail. See
   [Library Management Maven/Ivy section][] in the [SBT Manual][] for
   details. Also see this [email thread][SBT-repo-email-thread]. Depending
   on your circumstances, you may also need to specify the dependent
   repositories used by the [Grizzled Scala][] library.

## Source Code Repository

The source code for AVSL is maintained on [GitHub][]. To clone the
repository, run this command:

    git clone git://github.com/bmc/avsl.git

## Building from Source

Building the library requires [SBT][] and Scala 2.8.0. Install SBT, as
described at the SBT web site. Then, assuming you have an `sbt` shell
script (or .BAT file, for Windows), run:

    sbt update

That command will pull down the external jars on which the AVSL
Library depends. After that step, build the library with:

    sbt compile package

The resulting jar file will be in the top-level `target` directory.
